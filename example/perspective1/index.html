      the page (NaN somewhere, sorry about that).</p>

    <p>Old software-rendering tricks ride again!</p>

    <ul>

      <li>&lt;canvas&gt; can be abused to provide affine
	triangle-texture-mapping: set a triangular clip region,
	compute the right tranformation matrix, and then call
	drawImage().  Similar to the way Papervision3d works in Flash.
	See drawTriangle in jsgl.js for details.  This works
	especially well in Chrome, because it doesn't antialias clipping regions.
        Hopefully they never "fix" that.</li>

      <li>Affine texture mapping has glaring artifacts if there's much
        depth -- textures look like they're swimming.  Back in the
        days of software rendering, I experimented with recursive
        subdivision and I knew it worked, though it wasn't as fast on
        Pentium as the technique pioneered by Quake and Descent, where
        your scanline fill routine calculates the correct 1/z every 8
        or 16 pixels.</li>

      <li>However, scanline subdivision is not really feasible in
        Javascript, where we're relying on &lt;canvas&gt; to fill our
        pixels using native code.
        So, triangle subdivision makes sense.</li>

      <li>The subdivision method is fairly simple; the idea is that
        each triangle edge is tested to see how badly it needs
        perspective correction.  Each edge is tested independently.
        Each edge that needs subdivision is bisected.  This gives 8
        cases for any triangle (each edge can either be bisected, or
        not), generating between 1 and 4 output triangles.  Then the
        process is applied recursively.  Because it is edge centric, adjacent
        triangles make the same decisions for shared edges, and there are no
        t-junctions.</li>

      <li>This works pretty well.  However, it does have some bizarre
        swimming artifacts of its own, when combined with conventional
        near-plane clipping.  The problem is that the new vertices
        generated by clipping are highly sensitive to the relationship
        of near_z to the original triangle verts, so they cause the
        clipped triangle boundaries to crawl around, and that makes
        the perspective correction swim around distractingly.  I
        implemented an alternative method of near-plane clipping to
        prevent the crawling.  It works by bisecting the edges of triangles
        that cross the near_z plane to form four subtriangles.
        Some of those new triangles are completely behind
        near_z and are discarded; some are completely in front and are
        retained, and some are still spanning near-z, and are processed
        recursively.  I use a margin around near_z so the recursion
        eventually terminates.  (Sadly, the way I'm doing this clipping does
        make t-junctions all over the place.  Cie la vie.)</li>
